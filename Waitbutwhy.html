<!-- hi -->







<p>The same thing would happen when one human figured out a new clever trick. One unusually-intelligent hunter particularly attuned to both star constellations and the annual migration patterns of wildebeest<a href="#" class="footnote-button" data-footnote-identifier="1" alt="See Footnote 1" rel="footnote" data-footnote-content="<p>Ridiculous of wildebeest to not be spelled wildebeast.</p>"><span>1</span></a> herds could share a system he devised that used the night sky to determine exactly how many days remained until the herd would return. Even though very few hunters would have been able to come up with that system on their own, through word-of-mouth, all future hunters in the tribe would now benefit from the ingenuity of one ancestor, with that one hunter’s crowning discovery serving as every future hunter’s <em>starting point</em> of knowledge.</p>
	
<p>But painstakingly handwritten books were treated like treasures,<a href="#" class="footnote-button active click-instantiated" data-footnote-identifier="2" alt="See Footnote 2" rel="footnote" data-footnote-content="<p>A guy recently <a href=&quot;http://www.today.com/popculture/man-unveils-1-150-page-bible-written-hand-2D80556484&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;>hand-wrote the Bible</a> and it took him 13 years.

And then came another breakthrough: the printing press.</p>
