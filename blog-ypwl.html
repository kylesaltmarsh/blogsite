                <p>It was a Wednesday afternoon, I was checking my university emails, the constant reminder that I am yet to finish writing up my PhD thesis, when something caught my eye.</p>

                <p>Well, my PhD research unfortunately fell outside of these fields, but since I was captivated by the luxurious prize, I read on.</p>

                <p>My neurons were starting to fire. I liked presenting, and I didn‚Äôt think I was that bad at it either, and hey, if it isn‚Äôt based on the technical content itself, who cares if my PhD isn‚Äôt in the field, right? I continued to read.</p>

                <h1>üòïüòï</h1>
                <p>This was two days away. I sat back and pondered. Two days was‚Ä¶ troublesome to say the least. However, I had one thing going for me. I did not have anything to lose. So I sent in my application, apologising for the lateness of my entry. The organiser replied quickly - stating I would be the final speaker of the night.</p>
                <p>It was happening. On the drive home from work, I had another problem to solve, what the hell was I going to talk about? Here is what I knew, most likely the average competitor would be masters or PhD students who were actually conducting research in the field. So I probably could not win by the content of my presentation. I started to get desperate as I thought perhaps cheap parlour tricks and entertainment was my only chance.</p>
                <p>But then I had a brainwave.</p>
                <p>In 2017 I competed in the Unearthed hackathon. ‚ÄòHow can we more effectively use sound in the mining industry?‚Äô. It fit under the umbrella of mining, and it was somewhat related to my PhD research, which is in submarine acoustics. It was the best shot I had. </p>
                <p>During the hackathon, we addressed the challenge by combining beam forming technology (to extract individual sound sources from nosiy environments), signal processing and predictive modelling for the classification of equipment health purely by its sound signature. We tested our solution framework using sounds from Woodside‚Äôs fans, for which we had recordings of healthy fans and those with corroded bearings.<a href="#" class="footnote-button" data-footnote-identifier="1" alt="See Footnote 1" rel="footnote" data-footnote-content="<p>Details about the hackathon can be found <a href=&quot;http://www.news.uwa.edu.au/201705249639/awards-and-prizes/team-ems-takes-home-innovator-award-unearthed&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;>here</a> and <a href=&quot;https://unearthed.solutions/news/perth-hackathon-unearths-gold-mine-valuable-solutions-newcrest-and-south32&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;>here</a>.</p>"><span>1</span></a></p>
                <p>So I started throwing together slides, explaining the hackathon, the problem, our solution and how the technical aspects worked. But I needed more, it wasn‚Äôt enough.I was currently working on an account at Rio Tinto, developing a natural language processor machine learning model to read and annotate site workers shift logs. I decided to ask some of the Rio Tinto engineers if they knew of any applications of using acoustics on site for condition monitoring. One of the Rio Tinto engineers, gave me the perfect answer.</p>
                <p><em>RailBam.</em></p>
                <p>What RailBam does, is it used beam forming, signal processing and predictive modelling (sounds familiar right?) to monitor the acoustic emissions of each wheel of railway vehicles passing at line speed.<a href="#" class="footnote-button" data-footnote-identifier="2" alt="See Footnote 2" rel="footnote" data-footnote-content="<p><a href=&quot;https://www.wabtec.com/products/7314/railbam%C2%AE-bearing-acoustic-monitor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;>Here</a> is the link if you are interested.</p>"><span>2</span></a></p>
                <p>I had mixed emotions about this discovery. The first, was immediate excitation as this tied in so perfectly to my presentation. The second, was anger,  fuelled by the memory of our pitch in the hackathon. We pitched the general solution framework, and discussed possible applications, mentioned the use of RailBam for bearings would have been a perfect way to show the feasibility of the general solution approach.</p>
                <p>But anyway, that was done, and this competition was not. So I stayed up to 1 am on the Friday night, the day of the competition, and finally finished putting together a presentation I was happy with. It was time to sleep.</p>
                <p>It was competition day. I practiced over lunch whilst I ate one of the 50 sausage rolls I had made the week prior.<a href="#" class="footnote-button" data-footnote-identifier="3" alt="See Footnote 3" rel="footnote" data-footnote-content="<p>During university I decided to start batch making sausage rolls and freezing them for lunches. I started off doing 20 at a time, then 30, then 40. One time I even did 60, but I severely underestimated the time it would take. I spent the hours of 10 PM - 3 AM waking up every to an alarm every 40 minutes to take the last batch out and put the new batch in. I guess I had a adopted the true baker work style.</p>"><span>3</span></a> I was in my happy place. I ran through my presentation individually with both my IBM colleague and my Rio Tinto client. I find that running presentations individually, widens the line of feedback from each person, and much more valuable then doing the presentation to both simultaneously. People are generally more open and willing to give feedback and critism in privacy rather than in a group. Conversely, I am also more receptive. Beyond that, it also allows you to incorporate the first set of feedback before presenting to your next audience. I commonly did this when preparing for stand up routines, where I would gauge how certain sections of my routine would play out, and fine tune and adjust them those based off my personal feel for their delivery and the direct feedback I received. That being said - I would also say it is very important to take feedback for what it is, optional. Not all feedback is absolute, and it is up to you to listen to the feedback, judge it impartially, and then decide the action to take. One thing I I have learnt in gaining feedback for my presentations, is that everyone has their own ideas and preferences. When you try to incorporate all of that feedback, you may lose your personal identity. To me, a strong sense of personal identity is the most critical part of a presentation. Your personality needs to shine through. You need to be genuine. It is a well known phycological fact that we feel more connected with those who are genuine. This also applies to presenting. In order to establish a real, positive connection with your audience, you need to be genuine. So, seek feedback, but remember, it is up to you to analyse this feedback, and keep what makes you you. </p>
                <p>It was 4:30 PM, I was due to start at 5. I left the office in a hurry. As I stepped into my car, I heard a loud rip. I looked down to see that my pants had ripped from my crutch all the way to the back of my bum. I slowly rested my head on the steering wheel. This was a bad omen.</p>
                <p>What were you thinking Kyle? That you were just going to roll out of bed, win a competition and have your dream holiday in South Africa? Things dont work that way. This just was not meant to be. It was a nice fairy tale, but its time to come back to reality.</p>
                <p>This continued for about half the drive the eventually I said, Okay thats enough of that. You‚Äôve come this far, you‚Äôre not going to let a rip in your pants derail this whole operation Kyle.<a href="#" class="footnote-button" data-footnote-identifier="4" alt="See Footnote 4" rel="footnote" data-footnote-content="<p> I talk to myself a fair bit actually, I find it keeps me sane.</p>"><span>4</span></a> </p>
                <p>I arrived at the venue, just as the previous speaker wrapped up their presentation. I was barely seated for 2 minutes before the chair began to introduce me.</p>
                <p>I was up.</p>
                <p>There are a few things I like to do before I present.</p>
                <p>The first, which I am not entirely sure really works for me but I do it anyway, is I tell myself that I am excited. Telling yourself that you are excited is a common phycological ploy. Published by the American Psychological Association,¬†the <a href="https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2013/12/performance-anxiety.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study</a> that when people tell themselves to get excited, they perform better than they do when they tell themselves to calm down. "When people feel anxious and try to calm down, they are thinking of all the things that could go badly. When they're excited, they're thinking of all the things that could go well," said study author Alison Wood Brooks, PhD.</p>
                <p>The second, is that force myself to smile. It is also well known that certain actions by the body send messages to receptors in your brain. By smiling, you trick your brain that you are happy, and in turn, you feel happier. I find that this actually works for me.</p>
                <p>The third, is that I take a few deep breathes (while still smiling) right before I take the stage. Doing this, relaxes me and makes sure I start off my presentation without rushing.</p>
                <p>For me, I find that the first 30 seconds of a speech are the most critical. If the first 30 seconds go well, I completely relax into the presentation and flow naturally. If the first 30 seconds do not go well, I find myself starting to panic and then I  overthink things. For me, I therefore ensure that I know the first 30 seconds of my presentation, down to a tee. This is the only part of the presentation that I 'rote learn'. I find this starts me off on a positive note, and then the rest comes naturally. Perhaps this is a weakness of mine that I need to work on, and that a better presenter may be able to recover better than I do from a bad start. One thing I know is that, this 30 second philosophy of mine became very obvious to me in performing stand-up. When the audience laughed at my opening joke, I went on a roll. When the first joke fell flat, I found it tough to recover for the rest of my set. Anyway - it is something I am working on, but for me currently, I put a lot of effort into making sure the first 30 seconds go perfectly.</p>
                <p>Now, I am going to breakdown and discent my entire presentation, giving insights and analysis into the details of the presentation and the effects that they have on the audience.</p>
                <h4 class="mb-3 mt-5 mb-3">Slide No. 1</h4>
                <img src="images/slides/Slide01.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                <p>An <a href="http://time.com/3858309/attention-spans-goldfish/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">article</a> published by TIME magazine in 2015 quoted research from Microsoft implying that humans now have an attention span of just 8 seconds ‚Äì which is allegedly less than that of a goldfish.What this means is that if you do not capture the attention of your audience at the very start of your presentation, you may lose them entirely.</p>
                <p>I started my presentation off with a small story.</p>
                <div style="margin-left: 1em;">
                  <p><em> <b>"On a mine site, a technician can be walking past a piece of equipment and stop dead in his tracks, because they know that something doesn't sound quite right. Just from the sound signature alone‚Ä¶ the technician has determined that this piece of equipment may be faulty, and if they are good, they could probably tell you exactly what is wrong with it. This is a form acoustic based condition monitoring, which is the topic of my presentation today."</b>  </em></p>
                </div>
                <p>I find that starting off your presentation with an attention grabber is also very important, it can be a story, it can be a question to the audience, an interesting or confronting fact. It does not matter, as long as it is not the usual dull introduction of the title of your presentation.</p>
                <h4 class="mb-3 mt-5 mb-3">Slide No. 2</h4>
                <img src="images/slides/Slide02.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                <p>The next step of my presentation was the about me. I am a big fan of having an about me section in your presentation. It humanises you. Depending on what is appropriate for the presentation, I give the audience different details about myself. For this presentation, I focussed on my education, my previous work experience and my current role. </p>

                <div style="margin-left: 1em;">
                    <p><em><b>"I am from Perth, Australia, the most isolated city in the world. I studied mechanical engineer, physics and applied mathematics at the University of Western Australia. I then worked at BHP Billiton where I thought I would fulfil an illustrious career as a mechanical engineer. I was there for less than year however, because I realised that my true passion was solving technical problems, and so I decided to go back to uni to do my PhD. Now, you can see that I am a little less happy the second time around, and that is because I am still writing my thesis. But I have entered the professional world again, working as a Data Scientist for IBM, contracted to Rio Tinto Iron Ore."</b></em></p>                  
                </div>
                <p>There are three things to note here. The first, is that I have used a Lego theme to in my presentation. This may seem childish, but there was a reason for it. The tone I chose set for my entire presentation, was to be fun and light hearted. Besides, Everybody likes Lego.</p>
                <p>The second, is that I usually find speaking about my education and work experience quite dry. Sometimes, it might even be percieved as arrogant. I actually do not enjoy intellectual boasting, it seperates yourself from your audience, which is the opposite effect I desired. <a href="#" class="footnote-button" data-footnote-identifier="5" alt="See Footnote 5" rel="footnote" data-footnote-content="<p> However I will not lie, I dont mind it if someone else does it for me.</p>"><span>5</span></a>  But for a technical presentation, I felt it was necessary to show that I am credible to lecture on this topic. The combination of my engineering degree and work experience at BHP Billiton qualify me to the audience to present on a mining related topic. My PhD in acoustics qualify me to talk about the use of sound on mine sites, and my current role as a Data Scientist for IBM, but contracted to Rio Tinto, qualifies me to talk about the application of data science in the mining industry.</p>
                <p>The third, is the use humour. I do love using humour in my presentations, and I like to do it early. This works to do two extremely important things. 1) disarm and relax the audience 2) disarm and relax myself. The about me part of the presentation is perfect to do this, as I think it is important to adopt a more serious and professional persona for the meat of the presentation. You do not want to be joking around too much whilst you are trying to explain the technical content, this will reduce your audiences view of your credibility. Humour has to be used naturally and you have to understand your audience. Notice the frowning face that I edited onto the Lego man that represents the PhD phase of my education. I knew, from stalking the judging panel on LinkedIn, that many of them held PhDs. What this means, is that they will too, understand the pain of completing a PhD. They will relate, and are likely to enjoy the humour, and they did. </p>
                
                <h4 class="mb-3 mt-5 mb-3">Slide No. 3</h4>
                <img src="images/slides/Slide03.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                <p>The next part of my presentation, was explaining what exactly I was going to be presenting about. I find the audience is settled in by this point and ready to listen, but you do not want to scare them off. You have to start off easy to hook them in. I used this slide to do a two things, explain what acoustic condition monitoring actually is and to further define the scope of the presentation. </p>

                <div style="margin-left: 1em;">
                    <p><em><b>"Sounds tell stories. Now we have already given the example about the on site technician who can simply listen to the equipment sounds and know if there is a problem, but who here has ever booked their car in for a service when it started making funny noises? That is also an example acoustic based condition monitoring. We do this all the time, with our computers, our refrigerators‚Ä¶ even our partners. We know by the way something sounds, whether there is a problem. But technology can also do this, and that is what I really want to focus on today."</b></em></p>                  
                </div>
                <p>Again, the theme is light, there is some humour, it is relateable. The audience has a good feel for what acoustic based condition monitoring is and they now know the focus will be on using technology to perform it. </p>
                <!-- <a href="#" class="footnote-button" data-footnote-identifier="6" alt="See Footnote 6" rel="footnote" data-footnote-content="<p>The joke about using acoustic based condition monitoring on our partners actually made me lose my train of thought because the photographer in the audience started laughing.</p>"><span>6</span></a> -->
                
                <h4 class="mb-3 mt-5 mb-3">Slide No. 4</h4>
                <img src="images/slides/Slide04.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                <p>I then go straight to a real world application, the application of RailBam at Rio Tinto. I do this for a few reasons, to give the audience an object to focus their attention and to showcase the importance of the topic. From working in corporate environments, the focus or presentation must always be on value. From my experience in academia, the focus is on technical content. I wanted to find a happy middle ground for this presentation. Yes, the competition was based on the ability to explain technical content, however people like to have a story to follow. They need to know why it is important. The audience needs a reason to want to understand the technical content.</p>
                <div style="margin-left: 1em;">
                <p><em><b>"Now, I want to start with an example. Has anyone here heard of RailBam? So a few years ago, Rio Tinto installed a technology called RailBam along their railway line. What RailBam does is it monitors the condition of the bearings on the wheels of the wagons, just by the sound signature that they are emitting. So as the train drives past this juncture that you see here, these boxes use microphones to listen to the sounds of each of the bearings, as its moving at full speed by the way, to determine the health of each and every individual bearing, and then log the results."</b></em></p>
                <p><em><b>"Western Australia is the largest exporter of iron ore in the world and the Rio Tinto owns the largest privately owned railway line in the world. This means that the trains at Rio Tinto Western Australia can be over a two kilometres long. That is hundreds of wagons and thousands of bearings on a single train. Now, I actually have an audio clip of a train going by on the rail line.
